# Health Risk Prediction
This task involves the classification of some patients' health records and predicting the health risk class by applying different machine-learning methods. Using supervised model algorithms, the models are trained on a provided health dataset. A base model is chosen and compared against the other models. Then the best-predicting model is used to predict the data that the model has not seen. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering is also performed.
